        Security issues of the IoT
        </h1>
        <p>
            The Internet of Things (IoT) presents a series of unknowns for users, ranging from privacy to security.
            The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) is continuous and there are an increasing number of devices in daily use connected to the network. The same happens in industries, where there is a trend towards the interconnection of autonomous and intelligent factories.
            Technology is moving towards hyper-connectivity in platforms, networks, applications and devices, but all of this requires protection measures, proportionate to the intelligence of the devices and their behaviour.

                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold">1. Ecosystem Complexity</h5>              
                        <p >Since it should not look like a compendium of stand-alone devices, IoT becomes tangled in its complexity. IoT should to be understood as a rich, broad and diverse ecosystem that integrates people, communications and interfaces.
                        Although it simplifies life and industrial production, the application of the concept is not simple, as there are many components in its ecosystem. These range from sensors (devices), networks (bridges, routers, WiFi technology, LiFi, etc.) technological standards (protocols: network, communication and data) and regulations (confidentiality and security).

                        <p>
                            Many IoT devices come with inherent limitations in power, processing and memory.
                            As a consequence, they are not always managed with the advanced security patterns the need, which is why they are at greater risk of being attacked or succumbing to defects.
                            That’s why the architecture of the equipment has to be scalable because it’s a way to offer security.

                        <p>
                            As technologies related to the Internet of Things are in many cases still relatively new, we do not have a background of previous threats to let us know about failures in protection. There are not many cybersecurity experts specializing in IoT. A few basic rules are barely available.

                        <p>
                            There are computer programs specially designed to attack IoT devices and the ecosystem itself. These are threats called malware. They perform unwanted actions without the user’s consent, causing damage and data theft.
                            Exploit Sequences are other code-based abuses that take advantage of fragile points to access the system, hitting the infrastructure with a high to severe impact, depending on the assets affected.

                        <p>
                            When we accept any contract without reading or understanding the clauses it contains, and in truth we all do sometimes, the privacy of our information is at risk.
                            You are not alone. The number of people who click “accept” without understanding or even reading the terms when using applications or devices to work with the Internet of Things is extremely high.
                            Manufacturers, eager to stay one step ahead of the competition, do not always apply enough diligence towards auditing their equipment sufficiently, and often do not dedicate sufficient resources to ensure that those who embrace these devices within their lives can be fully confident.

                        <p>
                            In order to reduce costs, manufacturing companies could limit security investment. The result can be equipment that can never provide adequate protection. The end user would always be at risk.
                            Reducing costs in hardware as well as in development in this context can be a terrible mistake. The user is the one who ends up paying.

                        <p>
                            Regarding safety in IoT devices, there are three key players: manufacturer, service provider and user. In the event of a cyber attack, the assignment of responsibilities is not entirely clear and can lead to conflicts.
                            Another important aspect is how security would be managed when a component is shared between several parties.

                        <p>
                            At the heart of most security problem’s in IoT is that the user is often unaware of how the data they transmit via sensor devices will be used, because conventional methods of consent are of poor quality, i.e. they do not specify the subsequent handling of personal information.
                            Such information could reach third parties, and the user will not be aware of this.

                        </h5>              
                        <p>
                            The speed with which IoT devices are to be manufactured limits safeguard considerations, and the budget is likely to have an impact, which means the company would emphasize usability rather than security.

                        <p>
                            It’s linked to a lack of rigour in data processing. Sometimes we assume that anonymity is guaranteed in any service we use, but it really is not.
                            In IoT, to guarantee this, it is necessary to optimize the techniques of access control, encryption, design privacy, safeguarding the location and any basic aspect to avoid any undesired intervention.
